## Captionbot - Image Caption Generator Model for Assisted vision people  

**Description :** Image caption generator is a task that involves computer vision and natural language processing concepts to recognize the context of an image and describe them in a natural language like English.Python based project as captionbot for blind or blurred vision people â€“ Learn to Build Image Caption Generator with CNN & LSTM.

> **Type of Dataset :** For the image caption generator, we will be using the **Flickr_8K dataset**. There are also other big datasets like **Flickr_30K** and **MSCOCO** dataset but it can take weeks just to train the network so we will be using a small Flickr8k dataset. The advantage of a huge dataset is that we can build better models.

> **About Dataset used for this model**
* Name of dataset : Flickr_8K dataset  
* Source of dataset : [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ming666/flicker8k-dataset)
* Description of dataset : Contains 8091 photographs in JPEG format.

**Future Goals : What I do using this model**  

_**Steps :**_      
* First of all train ML Model on `Best dataset`(so that it can predict better) and Create `tflite`. 
* After Creating tflite, Build or integrate this `model.tflite` in android studio.
* Now, front end-> `ImageView`, `TextView`, `select(From Internal)`, `capture(Camera)` and `predict` button in Android Studio.
* Code for backend working Implementation => show output `caption` in `textview` as well as convert this `text to speech` for blind people or blurred vision people.
* Finally Improve Front end of App for Better Visuals(Colorful and splashscreen & Headlines - Caption Bot for assisted vision)
* App is ready to `predict`.
