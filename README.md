**Future Goals : What I do using this model**  

Integration with android application and camera.  
text to speech.

_**Steps for project :**_   
Captionbot for Assisted Vision (**Computer vision project : Image Caption Generator**)   
* First of all train ML Model on `Best dataset`(so that it can predict better) and Create `tflite` [ you can checkout some youtube videos for creating tflite ] 
* After Creating tflite, Build or integrate this `model.tflite` in android studio.
* Now, front end-> `ImageView`, `TextView`, `select(From Internal)`, `capture(Camera)` and `predict` button in Android Studio.
* Code for backend working Implementation => show output `caption` in `textview` as well as convert this `text to speech` for blind people or blurred vision people.
* Finally Improve Front end of App for Better Visuals(Colorful and splashscreen & Headlines - Caption Bot for assisted vision)
* App is ready to predict.
